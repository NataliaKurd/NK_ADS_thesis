# Thesis Repository

This repository contains the code and data associated with my thesis on evaluating a transformer-based model for information extraction tasks, specifically focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). The study was conducted in collaboration with Knights Advanced Analytics.

## Repository Structure

1. **data_exploration.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the exploration of the news article data.
2. **data_preparation.ipynb**: Preparation of the data for labeling in Label Studio and train & test split function.
3. **ner_LUKE_spaCy.ipynb**: Comparison of the LUKE and spaCy models for the NER task (including fine-tuning of the models).
4. **re_LUKE_REBEL.ipynb**: Fine-tuning and comparison of LUKE and REBEL models for RE.
